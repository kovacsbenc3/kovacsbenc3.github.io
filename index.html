                    <p>This webpage is the beginning of my whole new and exciting studies & career. 
                    I think creative coding can't be compared with a boring calculating of economics, isn't it?
                    </p>
                    <p>I was an economics student at BGE. After I finished it, I decided to learn someting 
                    completely different that I love to do. I hope I found it.
